It has an application process unit with cortex a9 and FPGA fabric. The board also contains interfaces like SDIO and QSPI. I want to install Linux on it directly with yocto and without petalinux, which runs yocto behind the scene, so I tried to eliminate the need to use it. Why do so?
It is interesting, and I have a lot of experience with yocto and it very easy to work with its script once you know it easy porting to other processors: IMX, stm32Mp157, etc&amp;rsquo; using build tools like CMake,Autotools, and yocto scripts make it very easy to port SW between different processors.</description></item></channel></rss>
