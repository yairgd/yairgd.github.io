My name is Yair Gadelov, I have worked as professional RT/Embedded Software Engineer for almost a decade, before that that I worked an algorithm engineer about 5 years and worked with machine learning, signal processing, and numerical analysis. I have leadership capabilities work in a team and as a self-depended.

I hold an MSc degree from Ben-Gurion University, Israel, in electrical engineering and have a vast experience in the development of algorithms, SW and HW. I'm highly skilled in multiple coding languages and have experience in leading projects, developing and designing products from scratch in fields of navigation and cutting-edge technologies such as 3d printing and computer vision. 

These are some of the technologies I know and have experienced:

* Linux - Expert level in Linux stuff like User and Kernel space programming. Linux scripts like bash/pythons. Linux distributions like Gentoo, Debian, Embedded Linux and Yocto project and  BSP. GNU toolchain: GCC, GDB, Make, CMake, etc'.

* Microcontrollers: Low-level programming with CPUs like STM32/Atmel cortex M series, Soft microcontrollers like NIOS2. Boot loaders programming. Differents embedded environments like kail, IAR, and GNU tools (open OCD, cross compilers)

* HW & FPGA coding, HW tests, lab equipment, and bords bring up. I work with Zync-7000, Cyclone and spartan-6. I have a full-scale FPGA experience from design to simulation, synthesis,  flushing the code to FPGA,  testing and integration with SW (from bare metal to Linux userspace code).

* Programing  languages: c/c++, Matlab, python, java, and golang
