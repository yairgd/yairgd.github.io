<!-- <img src="" class="align-right"/> -->

This is my personal homepage mainly to record my work. I'm working as an Embbed SW engineer, but I love to work on stuff during my free time.

I have used this place to write technical [blogs](/blogs/) on embedded systems and programming.
You can also see my [CV](/cv/) and, or know a little bit more [about me](/about/).

This site is driven by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). You can find the source code of this site in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yairgd/yairgd.github.io/). The theme is modified from [Jefprod](https://github.com/Tazeg/hugo-blog-jeffprod).

Hugo is the **worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites**. It is written in Go.

It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* https://github.com/russross/blackfriday
* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
* https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop
* https://github.com/spf13/cobra
* https://github.com/spf13/viper
