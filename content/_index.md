My name is Yair Gadelov, and this is the homepage mainly to record my work. I'm working as an Embedded SW engineer, but I love to work on stuff during my free time. I have used this place to write technical [blogs](/blogs/) on embedded systems and programming. You can also see my [CV](/cv/), or know a little bit more [about me](/about/).

I wrote this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and stored its source code in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yairgd/yairgd.github.io/). I  modified and expand  [this](https://github.com/Tazeg/hugo-blog-jeffprod) theme for my purposes. For example, You can learn things like how to add comments to your Hugo blog  [here](https://yasoob.me/posts/running_staticman_on_static_hugo_blog_with_nested_comments/) and [here](https://www.datascienceblog.net/post/other/staticman_comments/) and learn more about [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#p).

[Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio)  is the **worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites**. It is written in Go and makes use of a variety of open source projects, including:

* https://github.com/russross/blackfriday
* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
* https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop
* https://github.com/spf13/cobra
* https://github.com/spf13/viper
