# Yair's CV

## Experience
Here is my CV. Its more than 15 years of experience in the Israeli Hi-Tech. I began as an Algorithm Engineer and switched role to  RT/Embedded Software engineer.

### BELKIN Laser Ltd - Medical device company. Embedded System Software Engineer

### 2017-2019: AppCard Inc - Manages customers clubs, Senior Software Engineer

Fully responsible and project lead of USB, RS232, 485 and Network sniffers to
grub receipts data of the point of sails and sending it to the backend for further
analysis. The product is SW/HW integrated and includes FPGA, custom board,
an application processor, USB components and more. The product was done
from scratch and had installed in fields.

*  Embedded Linux and BSP: IMX6, c/c++ programming under Linux Kernel/Userspace, Yocto build system, bash, python, GCC, gdb, makefiles, Autotools
* Xilinx FPGA & Board design: Verilog programming, I2C, SPI, UART, Board
bring up and testing, Lab equipment
* System architecture, IoT, Rest API, client programming
* Working with different functionalities: QA & Product, DevOps, Backend team

### January 2016 - December 2016 Senior: Nano Dimension - Builds and produces 3d printers,  Embedded SW Engineer 
I was in both teams: SW: C++programming for printer management
application team, HW: Building from scratch a printer head controller using
Xilinx Zynq7000. The job involved the following tasks:

* Linux embedded BSP, Linux kernel drivers,
* FPGA coding with Verilog, C/C++ programming,
* Bare metal and FreeRTOS programming of ARM cortex-m7

### Sep 2010 - December 2015: Coloright -  designed and developed hair coloring systems
I began as an algorithm engineer and switched role to SW/FW/HW Embedded engineer

#### 2011-2016: SW & HW Engineer
