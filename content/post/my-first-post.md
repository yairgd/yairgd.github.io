# first post

This is My first Hugo post. I decided to work with Hugo after I had an experience with word press. For me, writing documents in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#p) format and using GitHub to manage my files, tags, and categories instead of using MySQL database is much easier to manage and deploy.  To learn how to create such blog in Hugo you can try this [blog](https://dreambooker.site/2019/08/17/Hugo-Staticman-Travis/).
