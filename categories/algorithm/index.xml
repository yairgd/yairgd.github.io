The key challenges in pairs trading are to:
Choose a pair which will give you good statistical arbitrage opportunities over time Choose the entry/exit points One of the challenges with the pair trading is that cointegration relationships are seldom static.</description></item><item><title>Color transformation from Bayer to RGB</title><link>https://yairgd.github.io/posts/2020/02/color-transformation-from-bayer-to-rgb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yairgd.github.io/posts/2020/02/color-transformation-from-bayer-to-rgb/</guid><description>A Bayer filter mosaic is a color filter array (CFA) for arranging RGB color filters on a square grid of photosensors. Its particular arrangement of color filters is used in most single-chip digital image sensors used in digital cameras, camcorders, and scanners to create a color image. The filter pattern is 50% green, 25% red and 25% blue - see here. Color conversion algorithm The conversion algorithm is based on simple linear interpolation of pixels to find the missing value.</description></item></channel></rss>
